# HeartOrBrainGameApp
It  is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to motivate player about not to lose hope ever in life . Sometimes decisions are made by heart 
and sometimes by brain and  utlimately some circumstances make heart win while other makes brain win and sometimes draw happens.
 In some cases, it's important to make emotionally-driven decisions,especially in matters of the heart or when dealing with personal relationships. In other situations,
 a more logical and analytical approach is required,such as in problem-solving, critical thinking, or professional decision-making.

Ultimately, the best approach is often a balance between the heart and the brain, taking into account both your emotions and rationality to make well-rounded decisions.

The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and two players take turns to make their moves.
Player 1 uses (let's say)Heart, and Player 2 uses brain. The players alternate turns.
The game continues until one of the following conditions is met:
A player gets three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, in which case they win.
If no player achieves a winning combination and the grid is filled, the game is a draw, and no one wins.

Heart Or Brain GameApp is a relatively simple game, but it can still be an engaging and strategic activity, especially when both players are experienced. 
It's often used as a teaching tool for basic life theory and strategy.
